This is a Springboot eCommerce app for a small baking business.
It was created in collaboration with jamiepwhitt, lmstevens, and marybethausman.

In order to run the app, you will need API keys from Stripe. There is both a public key and a secret key, which can be created here: https://www.baeldung.com/java-stripe-api
Once you have the keys, you should enter them into your environment variables as 'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY' and 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'
